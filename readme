HOW TO RUN FOR SINGLE BAM FILE:

0. The BAM files are located in the folder /data/

1. For each BAM file we need to create an index with the following command:

samtools index I2367_rmdup.bam

2. After the index is created, we sort the BAM file with the following command
(probably not necessary procedure):

samtools sort I2367_rmdup.bam

3. Creating the 3-channel genetic images.

for one file:
python preprocessing_single.py opens one BAM file indicated in the __main__
function and returns 100 images (the parameters config['count'] and config['filename']
are responsible for the number of images and the filename to analyze)

for folder:

python preprocessing.py  --folder_in "/home/max/Desktop/DNA/data" --folder_out "/home/max/Desktop/DNA/output/new_images"
folder_in - the folder where bam files are located
folder_out  -the folder where the results are stored

4. Script color_vizualization returns the colors and its frequency in one file  as solid
images of specific color and the frequency as an image title

5. The ML algorithm:
- Reads images from all the subfolder of the folder output.
- Performs ML prediction based on the images
to run algorithm : image_regression.py
Inside of the file indicate the images file, and CONFIG.




FILES DESCRIPTION:

- dataloader.py           -  routines responsible for loading the data.
- image_regression.py     - creates an experiment.
- preprocessing_single.py - preprocesses single BAM file
- preprocessing.py        - preprocessing folder of BAM files:
- model.py                - the model architecture
- dataloader.py           - the dataloader that loads the data (automatically executed from image_regression.py during prediction)
- clean_image.py          - cleaning the images (creating certain number of files) after the preprocessing.py
- logger.py               - utilities file corresponding to the logging.
- meteo_test.py           - testing of the extracting the meteo data
- sort_bams.py            - TEMPORARY EXPERIMENT FILE
- color_visualization.py  - the visulaziation of the different colors of patch_images

HOW TO RUN (FOLDERS OF BAM file):

1. Determine the folder for the BAM files and empty folder for IMAGE files.

2. RUN the preprocessing.py to analyze the BAM files and create image files:
python preprocessing.py  --folder_in "path_to_BAM" --folder_out "path_to_IMAGES"

3. RUN the clean_image.py file. Indicate the target label and target image files inside of the clean_image script.
python clean_image.py

4. RUN  model.py. Indicate the input/output folders, experiment folders, etc in CONFIG file.
python model.py






*Important: The number of images for each of the BAM files should be no less than the specified number
